      <p>Welcome to this budget War Thunder Forum! This is a fanmade 'forum' that should compile lots of information into one homepage for beginners to look at. The official War Thunder Forum already exists, so this is just a project test bed for different aspects of code for school, but if someone actually stumbles upon this, hello! If you wanted the official forum, <a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/">click here!</a> Otherwise, below is a table concerning different topics to read up on:</p>

      <h2>A list of general vocabulary that you might hear from time to time:</h2>

      <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse:collapse;">

        <tr>
          <th>GENERAL VOCABULARY (may be accompanied with links)</th>
          <th>APPLIES TO (TIER):</th>
          <th>EXEMPLAR PLANES</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ONE-CIRCLE/TWO-CIRCLE - [insert link here]</td>
          <td>This applies to any tier where dogfighting is relevant. Best applies to Air Realistic Battles.</td>
          <td>All of the Bf-109 series, Yak series, Zero series (especially turnfighting), P-51 Mustangs etc. Anything with good energy retention.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ENERGY RETENTION - intensity of a maneuver in relation to speed loss/agility loss, basically, how long a plane can pull off sharp turns or climbs without stalling or being sluggish</td>
          <td>Every tier except mid-tier. Early jets tend to be much heavier with much less energy output - even very late prop-planes can catch up to early jets while having better retention!</td>
          <td>Literally the motive of the Bf-109 series, all F-15s, both I-185s and the I-225, Fw-190s, all Lavochkin planes in early tier etc.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>BOOM-AND-ZOOM - [insert link here]</td>
          <td>4-6 (low/mid-tier), normally used with planes that have poor mobility/turn rate but great engine power</td>
          <td>La-7, Mig-15, any heavy fighters, Me-262, I-225</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>MERGE - when two planes pass by each other head-to-head (usually to identify each others' planes) normally before a dogfight</td>
          <td>Every tier in Simulation Battles, should never need to happen in Air AB/RB due to player markers.</td>
          <td>Usually can happen to planes that aren't domestic (not unique to the country) and need identification such as 99% of Chinese planes and also Israeli planes.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>HEAD-ON - when two planes that face other start shooting to destroy each other without being destroyed.</td>
          <td>Much more used in mid-tier where missiles are less prevalent but planes are too fast for lead to be pulled. Many call this tactic 'unskilled', so beware.</td>
          <td>Mig-15, F-104, any plane with bad turn rate/roll rate but amazing guns.</td>
        </tr>

      <p>Any others that need crediting, you are probably not going to get it by now. I won't be checking this email address after the project is over so if you did contribute in any way, you can always just feel proud that you did so. However, if you really can't handle not having a mention on a static HTML page that no one will find, you can always try emailing on budgetwarthunderforum@gmail.com!</p>
