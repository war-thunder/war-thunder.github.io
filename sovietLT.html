    <h1>best fighter planes relative to battle rating (that i know)</h1>
    
    <div style="background-color:white;">

      <h2>1.0-2.0:</h2>
  
      <ol>
        <li><b>I-15 Chaika</b><p>This plane has great weaponry/firepower, easily beating that of any fighter of its time. It's quadruple ShKAS 7.62mm machine guns (with the right ammo belts) can shred any plane like an A-10. Talking about engine power does not disappoint for it boasts a max speed of 230 km/h with 775 horsepower and a rate of climb of 762 m per minute. It has a service ceiling of 9300m. It has two hardpoints with up to 330lb of external ordnance.</p></li>
        <li><b>I-15 M-25</b><p>This plane is basically the same as the I-15 Chaika except for the fact that it only boasts 2 ShKAS 7.62mm machine guns and a lesser 750hp. It's service ceiling is also less at 8600m.</p></li>
        <li><b>I-16 type 5</b><p>This should be the first monoplane you come unlock in the game. However, the flight characteristics are still comparable to a biplane, with a very good turn rate (16.5 secs to turn 360 degrees) and climb rate (18.5 m/sec). Its firepower, however, still retains the somewhat weak 2x 7.62 mm MGs, but they are ShVAK MGs, so not a big loss as relative to BR.</p></li>

      <h2>2.0-3.0:</h2>
    
      <ol>
        <li><b>Yak-7B</b><p>This plane is the predecessor to the Yak-1 and inherits all the great design/flight properties of the former model but better. However, by this point, it is CRUCIAL to learn trigger discipline, as it does not have that many bullets. This WILL become a trend with Soviet planes later on. Learn more about this skill on the trigger discipline webpage. On the bright side, the plane features 2x 12.7mm "UBS" MGs (400 rounds) and a 20mm ShVAK cannon with 120 rounds (nose-mounted). It has 2 hardpoints that can carry 2x50kg bombs and can carry 6 rockets.</p></li>
        <li><b>Yak-1B</b><p>This plane is the direct upgrade to the Yak-1. It has a maximum speed of 592 km/h at 1,210 HP and a service ceiling of 10,050m (don't expect to go that high though!). It has a turn rate of around 24.1 secs (at a height of 3000 m). Its firepower is around the same as the Yak-1 and Yak-7B. It boasts the same 2 hardpoints as the Yak-7B but can actually carry 100 kg bombs.</p></li>
        <li><b>MiG-3-34</b><p>This purpose-built interceptor is an outlier in that it actually flies pretty decently at high altitudes. It's max speed is 612 km/h (fully aced at 7800m) and its service ceiling is 11000m. Its rate of climb is 16 m/s (fully aced) and has a engine output of 1350 HP. Its turn time is a bit disappointing at 22 secs (when aced), but when you do manage to get on someone's six, it is an easy kill. This is because this plane has 2x 20mm ShVAK cannons. You should use this plane to take down bombers or boom-and-zoom.</p></li>

      <h2>3.0-4.0:</h2>
    
      <ol>
        <li><b>I-16 type 27</b><p>This plane is the direct upgrade to the I-16 type 5. Still retaining the same great flight characteristics and maybe even better, your only downside is the underwhelming engine with only 900 HP (at 4500m) that goes a little over 420 km/h. The armament, however, is great with 2x nose-mounted 7.62mm ShKAS MGs and 2x wing-mounted 20mm ShVAK cannons. While the engine power lags behind the technology of that BR, turn-fighting is way past any other plane, and the 2x 20mm will shred any plane that crosses your nose. This plane can also carry 6x rockets and 2 hardpoints for 2 50/100kg bombs.</p></li>
        <li><b>Yak-9</b><p>This aircraft is one of the best planes of the whole BR rating - once you master trigger discipline! This is definitely apparent when you use the Yak-9T/K. However, those are niche planes with great need for good aim and are not that forgiving compared to the original build. Starting with engine power, the M-105PF offers 1180 HP of thrust to ensure a max speed of 599 km/h (at 4300m). The turn circle takes 15-17 seconds, which is actually pretty comparable to the I-16. However, the armament shows as 1x 12.7mm ShVAK MG (200 rounds) and 1x 20mm UBS cannon (120 rounds).</p></li>
        <li><b>I-185 (M-82)</b><p>This plane is a great boom-and-zoom fighter, no questions asked. Its engine power is absolutely amazing, at 1330-1600 HP, making light work of reaching its top speed of 615 km/h (at 6470m). Its armament is even better, at 3x 20mm ShVAK cannons, with an ammo load of 560 rounds: more than forgiving unlike other Soviet planes. The ordnance options are even better, at 4 hardpoints for 2x or 4x 100kg bombs and 2x 250kg bombs. Either that or 8x AP or HE rockets. However, now we enter less favorable territory, with an abysmal 22 seconds of turn circle tragedy even when fully upgraded (and 24 seconds when stock) You should stick to playing as CAS/CAP in ground battles, intercepting bombers or boom-and-zooming when playing this aircraft.</p></li>
